react_agents_chris_hay
- discusses and illustrates the thought, action, observation processing of the ReAct agent design
- use a simple get time tool
- shows what's going on 'under the hood'
- compares 
  - agent/worker structure built using the langchain.agents package (hello-agent-3.py) with
  - agent/worker process created in simple langchain (hello-langchain-6.py)

build_react_agent_pavan_belagatti
- structured_chat_agent.py
  - simple agent using the langchain_community Tavily web search tool
  - uses ReAct prompt from the langchain hub
- reAct_AI_agent.py
  - more complicated agent, using two tools ('wikipedia', 'calculate')
  - Agent (instantiated from class 'Charbot') decides which tool to use
  - Agent uses Action step to pass tool name/tool input to script
  - Observation step allows agent to get tool results back

agent_tests
- simple agent/tool tests in LangChain
- tavily_test.py: uses langchain_community tool to search the web
- wikipedia_test.py: uses custom tool to search Wikipedia
